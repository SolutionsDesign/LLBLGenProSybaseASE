## Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) Driver / DQE for [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com)

This is the repository for the Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) Driver and Dynamic Query Engine (DQE) for [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) v5.x. It contains the sourcecode for the driver and DQE so users who move to v5.x and need to support Sybase ASE can continue to do so. Starting with v5.0, [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) doesn't officially support Sybase ASE anymore, and as a courtesy to our existing customers we have published the sourcecode for the driver and DQE here on GitHub under the flexible MIT license.

The code in this repository references LLBLGen Pro v5.0 assemblies. It's easy to adjust them to the LLBLGen Pro version you're using though. 

### Compatiblity
The sourcecode available here compiles against [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) v5.0.x assemblies. If you encounter code breaking changes, please file an issue on this repository so we can look into this. 

### Support on this sourcecode
While [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) officially doesn't support Sybase ASE, we strive to keep this code compileable against the latest [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) version, if feasible. As we no longer have access to any Sybase ASE database nor ADO.NET provider for ASE, we can't test the code ourselves (and which is also the reason why we no longer support it officially). Please file an issue here if you run into an issue with compiling the code. We can't fix bugs / issues in the code for you as we can't test it on live databases anymore. However if you want to fix an issue yourself but need advice how to do so, e.g. because you're unfamiliar with how things work internally in the system, please ask the question as an issue here on GitHub and we'll try to help you as best as we can. 

### Templates
The contents of the `Templates` folder has to be copied into the *LLBLGen Pro installation folder*`\Frameworks\LLBLGen Pro\Templates`. Depending on which version of LLBLGen Pro you're using the contents of this repository with, you have to adjust the `dqeReferenceXmlInclude.template` template in the `Templates\SybaseAseSpecific\Shared` folder: change `5.0.0.0` into the version you're using, e.g. `5.2.0.0`. Only Major/Minor version numbers matter, so e.g. v5.2.1 is still using assembly version 5.2.0.0. 

The public key token has been adjusted for you in this template to the new self-signing key shipped with the DQE sourcecode in this repository.

### Features of the driver / DQE

The driver supports: 

-   All features of Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise v12.x+ are
    supported except Java based types and proxy tables
-   Multiple catalogs per project.
-   Multiple schemas per catalog.
-   Floats with precision &lt; `16` are mapped on `System.Single`, `float`
    with precision &gt;= `16` are mapped on `System.Double`
-   Output parameters for procedures aren’t recognized, as Sybase ASE
    doesn’t store this information in the meta-data, so output
    parameters are always seen as input parameters.
-   Grouped (overloaded) procedures are supported.
-   numeric identity (Identity columns) are always set to DBType `int`.

### Compiling the Driver
To compile the driver, make sure the references in the SybaseAsaDBDriver csproj file are updated and point to the [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) v5.0.x designer installation. The driver dll is self-signed. Compiling is simple: just compile the csproj file. 

#### Deploying the driver
To use the driver, place the compiled dll it in the following folder: `<[LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) installation folder>\Drivers\SybaseASE`. 
Additionally, copy the file `driver.config` from the Driver folder into this folder. 

To see whether the driver is loaded by the designer, start the designer and go to `Tools->View Loaded External Types...` If the Sybase ASE driver is shown, it's loaded and usable. 

#### Driver ID
Drivers in [LLBLGen Pro](http://www.llblgen.com) use a GUID as 'ID'. This ID is hardcoded and is specified in the driver.config file and the DBDriver class. As this ID is also used in the templates
it's key you keep this ID the same as it is today. If you fork this codebase and change that ID, templates shipped with the designer won't work with the driver. 

The ID for Sybase ASA is: `3FABDE1A-21DF-4fcb-96FD-BBFA8F18B1EA`

### Compiling the Dynamic Query Engine (DQE)
To compile the DQE, make sure the references in the SybaseAseDQE csproj are updated and point to the ORMSupportClasses dll. The DQE dll is self-signed. The ORM Support classes package is [also available on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SD.LLBLGen.Pro.ORMSupportClasses/), for easy referencing.

#### Deploying the DQE
To use the DQE, just reference the compiled dll. See for more info about compiling the generated code and using a DQE, the [Compiling your code](http://www.llblgen.com/documentation/5.0/LLBLGen%20Pro%20RTF/Using%20the%20generated%20code/gencode_compiling.htm) topic in the 
[LLBLGen Pro Runtime Framework documentation](http://www.llblgen.com/documentation/5.0/LLBLGen%20Pro%20RTF/index.htm).
